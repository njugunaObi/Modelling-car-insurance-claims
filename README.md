# Modelling-car-insurance-claims

In this project i used a logistic regression model to determine claimances of car insurance by customers of an insurance company

The insurance data was pulled from kaggle.com and the entire data analysis and modelling was done in python.

The result gives the feature and accuracy that most likely leads to claims in car insurance.
